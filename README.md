# Gesture Detection in Video Sequences

This project is a Streamlit web application that detects gestures in video sequences using the Inflated 3D Convnet (I3D) model from TensorFlow Hub.

## Overview

The application allows users to upload two videos:
1. Gesture Video: Contains the gesture that needs to be detected in the test video.
2. Test Video: The video in which the gesture needs to be detected.

After uploading the videos, the user can click the "Process Videos" button to analyze the videos. The application will then determine if the gesture from the gesture video is present in the test video. If detected, it will display "Gesture is DETECTED in the test video." Otherwise, it will display "Gesture is NOT DETECTED in the test video."

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gesture-detection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd gesture-detection
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. Upload your gesture video and test video, then click the "Process Videos" button to detect gestures.
